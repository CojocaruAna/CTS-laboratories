1. Instantiation of the superhero associated with the player:
//we use builder
- there are many attributes to allow its customization(objects have many attributes)
- name, is Positive, points Life, weapon Left Hand, weapon 
Right Hand, super Power, is Wounded Critical, super Super 
Power, etc.;(the attributes)
- an efficient solution must be found that allows the 
creation of the superhero without giving values for all 
the attributes but also without allowing the programmers 
to omit some of them;(creational section -builder,singleton,prototype,simple factory)

2. All characters have a 3D graphic model:
//we use prototype
- instances of the same character can appear in the game(multiple objects with the same data)
- creating the 3D model is an expensive process because 
it involves loading and generating the model;(uses a lot of resources)
- an efficient solution must be found to create several 
instances of the same character;
